Hello My name is Daniel Jachetta III, or username DanielDavid521. Currently, I work at Commerce Bank In Kansas City in the Data Center as a Network Operations Specialist. Looking to further my career with my R data science skills to become a Data Scientist! I enjoy using the Tidyverse, Rmarkdown, and Shiny. I look to learn something new about R every day. I run the [808s and Dataviz](https://www.808sanddataviz.com) and [Cashflows and assets](https://www.cashflowandassets.com) blogs as well. 


<div style= "float:right;position: relative;">
```{r, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("me.jpg")
```
